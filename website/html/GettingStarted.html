<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    If you're the ready, fire, aim type (aren't all programmers?), you should find everything you need on this page and the page on Panel Basics to
    start using DuxPanel.
</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>

<pre>
    npm install @cojam/duxpanel
</pre>

<p>
    You also need to link to the <code>duxpanel.css</code> file in the <code>node_modules/@cojam/duxpanel/lib/</code>
    directory.
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="duxpanel.css"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
    @import '~@cojam/duxpanel/lib/duxpanel.css';
</pre>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
    You might be tempted to use the duxpanel.css file in your project with webpack and an import statement. This will work as long as you don't need
    to override any of the CSS in the file.
</div>

<h4>Browser Requirements</h4>

<p>
    DuxPanel doesn't place any special requirements on browser support. It has been tested on the modern evergreen browsers (Chrome and Firefox) as
    well as Internet Explorer 10 and 11. It definitely won't work on Internet Explorer 8 or earlier.
