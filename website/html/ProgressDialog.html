<h2>DuxProgressDialog</h2>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;DuxProgressDialog&gt;</code> component displays a progress dialog for potentially long operations.
    A progress bar and abort button are optional.  Furthermore, the dialog can delay opening for operations that are
    sometimes, but not always long such as web service calls.

            If true, an abort button is rendered in the dialog.  The onAbort property is required if true.

    <tr>
        <td>onAbort</td>
        <td>(none)</td>
        <td>This function is called if the user clicks the abort button.</td>

            For operations which are not always long, but can potentially take a while (such as web service calls),
            the dialog can delay showing with this property.  A timer is started when the show property transitions
            from false to true. Once the timer elapses, the dialog is displayed if show is still true.  This property
            is the number of milliseconds to delay.  If this property is 0, the dialog is displayed immediately when
            show becomes true.

            This is a React component to render the progress bar.  If not present, no progress bar is rendered.  For
            web sites using Twitter Bootstrap 4, <code>&lt;ProgressBarBS4&gt;</code> is supplied.  See below for an
            example of use.  The supplied component is passed the <strong>min</strong>, <strong>max</strong>, and
            <strong>value</strong> properties.
