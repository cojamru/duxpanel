<h2>Responsive Panels</h2>

<p>
    <code>&lt;DuxPanel&gt;</code> is designed to be responsive from Desktop browsers down to mobile devices. This is accomplished using a set of
    sizing breakpoints similar to Twitter's <a href="http://www.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> CSS framework.
</p>

<h4>Sizing Breakpoints</h4>

<p>
    There are five sizing breakpoints, defined to be exactly the same as Bootstrap. This simplifies web page design if your site is already using
    Bootstrap. These breakpoints are:
</p>

<table class="table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Breakpoint</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>xs</td>
            <td>Extra small devices (portrait phones, less than 576px)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>sm</td>
            <td>Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>md</td>
            <td>Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>lg</td>
            <td>Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>xl</td>
            <td>Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h4>Dimensions and Placement</h4>

<p>
    Panels are sized and located on the web page using one of three possible values: a number (actual pixels), a percent, or an object detailing sizes
    at specific breakpoints. If an object is supplied, the size at each breakpoint can be a number (actual pixels) or a percent. These values are
    recognized in the
    <code>&lt;DuxPanel&gt;</code> properties of <code>left</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code>. Here are some
    examples of this:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;DuxPanel width="50%" height={150} top={50}&gt;...&lt;/DuxPanel&gt;
</pre>

<p>Sizes and placement in breakpoints look like this:</p>

<pre>
    const width = {
        xs: "100%",
        sm: "90%",
        md: 400   // Numbers or percents can be used for each breakpoint
    };

    &lt;DuxPanel width={width} ...
</pre>

<p>
    Notice the width object is missing <code>lg</code> and <code>xl</code>. If a size breakpoint is missing from the object, the breakpoint for the
    next smallest screen is used. In this case, browsers with large or extra-large windows would fall back to the medium breakpoint. If the browser
    window is the <code>xs</code> size and that breakpoint is missing from the object, the next lowest breakpoint is used instead.
</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p>These two examples demonstrate a proportionally sized panel and one that changes its sizes using the responsive breakpoints.</p>
